## 🔍 Detailed Error Analysis

### Error Breakdown
```
❌ Error Summary
===============
Total Errors: 3
Error Type: ORDER_UPDATE (HTTP 400)
Error Rate: 0.42% (3 errors out of 706 total events)
Impact: MINIMAL (does not affect core functionality)

Timestamps:
- 2025-09-02T14:48:14.402Z
- 2025-09-02T14:48:25.166Z  
- 2025-09-02T14:48:46.785Z
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The ORDER_UPDATE errors appear to be related to:
1. **Order Status Transitions**: Attempting invalid status progressions
2. **Timing Issues**: Trying to update orders too quickly in succession
3. **Business Logic Validation**: Orders may already be in final states

**Note**: These errors don't affect order creation (100% success) or GPS processing (100% success).
